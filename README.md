# Air-quality-Analysis

When it comes to air pollution, India has made the news. One of the main issues for the government and the populace has been the country's increasing air pollution.

The government has made many attempts to reduce pollution, yet the issue persists.

The serious issue of air pollution should not be disregarded. The vast majority of people aren't even aware of the enormous harm that their daily breathing does.

Through the air quality analysis project the insights I gained are:-
1) Industrial areas contributes most in air pollution whether it is SO2,NO2,RSPM
2) Uttranchal has maximum amount of SO2 
3) West bengal has the maximum amount of NO2
4) Delhi contributes most in rspm
5) There is a close relation between SPM and RSPM, we get this relation with the help of heatmap.
